## Features

Shows the current regular expression's matches in a side-by-side document. This can be turned on/off with `Ctrl+Alt+M` (`⌥⌘M`).

Global and multiline options can be added for evaluation with a side-by-side document through a status bar entry. This can be useful when the side-by-side document has multiple examples to match.
